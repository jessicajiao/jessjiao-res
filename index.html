        <div class="subheading mb-5">English Major ðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">As a young child, I was heavily exposed to the world of writing and education. It greatly intrigued me and as such, I of course simply just had to decide that I wanted to choose to go to university in order to pursue said career in english and further my childhood aspirations. Of course, this only further increased my passion as I went through the rigorous classes here and I have enjoyed all the unique experiences this school has offered.<br><br>

        I became a translator for my parents at a young age. I picked up Mandarin and Cantonese before ever stepping foot in a school, and the English language opened many doors, enabling me to help my parents understand. My parents, as Chinese immigrants, did not know a modicum of English but saw America as an opportunity for my future and worked hard to provide financial support. I struggled with the responsibilities of answering phone calls, interpreting mail, buying essentials, and arranging medical appointments. Constantly switching between languages and grasping key concepts such as taxes as a child was stressful: I realized the freedom of being able to convey my words properly. 

Communication is a broad field. An English degree would equip me with the skills needed to craft impactful statements, help newly-launched organizations grow, and continuously improve media narratives on humanitarian causes. In middle school and high school, I actively joined clubs that let me create immersive PowerPoint presentations and speak to large groups of students. Becoming the secretary of Biology Club, the public relations officer of Chemistry Club, the marketing lead of the entrepreneurial LaunchX Club, and vice president of UNICEF taught me about the importance of communication in a collaborative environment. As a leader, I was responsible for envisioning goals, organizing responsibilities and fundraisers, and working with my peers to promote our nonprofit efforts. When documenting the rise in curious members who just discovered the clubs, I saw the significance of being a public relations publicistâ€”I could share my knowledge and offer my help to a larger audience.
<br><br>

        My parents focused on the necessity of pursuing higher education to develop a lucrative career. I understood but knew I did not have to accomplish my goals in a conventional way or forsake my interests for stability. For example, I always liked dogs and cats but could not afford to care for any, so I waited until I passed the age limit to volunteer weekly at Priceless Pets Rescue. As an English major, my coursework seemingly has no correlation to volunteering at an animal shelter, but I actually improved my interpersonal skills. I regularly conversed with the other volunteers during our hikes with the dogs, interacted with the rescue workers while caring for the cats, and made friends while enjoying the experience. Since I started college, I have worked hard to keep a 4.0 GPA, and I have won a Public Anthropology Award for Excellence in Writing on Public Issues with the Community Action Website. I also started working at the universityâ€™s dining hall and have communicated with many students. The joys of writing, freely communicating my ideas, and meeting new people, motivate me to continue learning. I hope to obtain a bachelorâ€™s degree in English and a Master of Arts in Communication, apply for internships with humanitarian organizations, and network and work at companies. I aspire to become a public relations publicist who can generate positive attention for pivotal issues and speak for worthy causes.
